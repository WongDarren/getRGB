# getRGB
getRGB is a little Digital Image Processing project I worked on.

## Installation and Usage
Download the source code and build it in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Once you run it, you will be able to load your own image and hover your mouse over any pixel of the image. The program will print the RGB value of the pixel you are hovering over and the values of the adjacent pixels.
