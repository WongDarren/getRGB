# getRGB
This project was one of my first projects in learning how to read information from pixels of an image.<br>
This program will return a set of colored boxes with the RGB values of the selected pixel in the center and the corresponding RGB values of adjacent pixels.<br>
Once an image has been loaded, the user may find the RGB value of the pixel by hovering over a spot with the mouse cursor.<br>
The results will be shown on the left and will update as the cursor moves.<br>

## Installation and Usage
Download the source code and build it in Microsoft Visual Studio.<br>

Once it's built, you can run it and will be able to load your own image and hover your mouse over any pixel of the image. <br>
The program will print the RGB value of the pixel you are hovering over and the values of the adjacent pixels.
