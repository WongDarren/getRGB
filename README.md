# getRGB
This project was one of my first projects in learning how to read information from pixels of an image.
This program will return a set of colored boxes with the RGB values of the selected pixel in the center and the corresponding RGB values of adjacent pixels.
Once an image has been loaded, the user may find the RGB value of the pixel by hovering over a spot with the mouse cursor.
The results will be shown on the left and will update as the cursor moves.

## Installation and Usage
Download the source code and build it in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Once it's built, you can run it and will be able to load your own image and hover your mouse over any pixel of the image. 
The program will print the RGB value of the pixel you are hovering over and the values of the adjacent pixels.
